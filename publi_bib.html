     The problem of computing dominators in a control flow graph is central
     to numerous modern compiler optimizations. Many efficient algorithms
     have been proposed in the litterature, but mechanizing the correctness
     of the most sophisticated algorithms is still considered as too hard
     problems, and to this date, verified compilers use less optimized
     implementations.
     In contrast, production compilers, like GCC or LLVM, implement the
     classic, efficient Lengauer-Tarjan
     algorithm, to compute dominator trees. And
     subsequent optimization phases can then determine whether a CFG node
     dominates another node in constant time by using their respective
     depth-first search numbers in the dominator tree.

     In this work, we aim at integrating such techniques in verified
     compilers. We present a formally verified validator of untrusted
     dominator trees, on top of which we implement and prove correct a fast
     dominance test following these principles.
     We conduct our formal development in the Coq proof assistant, and
     integrate it in the middle-end of the CompCertSSA verified
     compiler. We also provide experimental results showing performance
     improvement over previous formalizations.

     Abstract The Static Single Assignment (SSA) form is a predominant
     technology in modern compilers, enabling powerful and fast
     program optimizations. Despite its great success in the
     implementation of pro- duction compilers, it is only very
     recently that this technique has been introduced in verified
     compilers. As of today, few evidence exist on that, in this
     context, it also allows faster and simpler optimizations. This
     work builds on the CompCertSSA verified compiler (an SSA branch
     of the verified CompCert C compiler). We implement and verify two
     prevail- ing SSA optimizations: Sparse Conditional Constant
     Propagation and Global Value Numbering. For both transformations,
     we mechanically prove their soundness in the Coq proof
     assistant. Both optimization proofs are embedded in a single
     sparse optimization framework, factoring out many of the
     dominance-based reasoning steps required in proofs of SSA-based
     optimizations. Our experimental evaluations indicate both a
     better precision, and a significant compilation time speedup.

       This paper reports on the design and soundness proof, using the

       language (excluding recursion and dynamic allocation).  Verasco
       establishes the absence of run-time errors in the analyzed

       relational and non-relational.  Verasco integrates with the
       CompCert formally-verified C~compiler so that not only the

       certitude, but also the fact that these guarantees carry over to

       Program slicing is a well-known program transformation which
       simplifies a program with respect to a given criterion while
       preserving its semantics. Since the seminal paper published by
       Weiser in 1981, program slicing is still widely used in various
       application domains. State of the art program slicers operate
       over program de- pendence graphs (PDG), a sophisticated data
       structure combining data and control dependences.
       
       In this paper, we follow the a posteriori validation approach to
       formally verify (in Coq) a general program slicer. Our validator
       for program slicing is efficient and validates the results of a
       run of an unverified program slicer. Program slicing is
       interesting for a posteriori validation because the correctness
       proof of program slicing requires to compute new supplementary
       information from the PDG, thus decoupling the slicing algorithm
       from its proof.
       
       Our semantics-preserving program slicer is integrated into the
       CompCert formally verified compiler. It operates over an
       intermediate language of the compiler having the same
       expressiveness as C. Our experiments show that our formally
       verified validator scales on large realistic programs.

     Cache-based attacks are a class of side-channel attacks that are
     particularly effective in virtualized or cloud-based environments,
     where they have been used to recover secret keys from cryptographic
     implementations. One common approach to thwart cache-based attacks is
     to use constant-time implementations, i.e., which do not
     branch on secrets and do not perform memory accesses that depend on
     secrets.  However, there is no rigorous proof that constant-time
     implementations are protected against concurrent cache-attacks in
     virtualization platforms with shared cache; moreover, many prominent
     implementations are not constant-time. An alternative approach is to
     rely on system-level mechanisms. One recent such mechanism is stealth
     memory, which provisions a small amount of private cache for programs
     to carry potentially leaking computations securely. Stealth memory
     induces a weak form of constant-time, called S-constant-time,
     which encompasses some widely used cryptographic
     implementations. However, there is no rigorous analysis of stealth
     memory and S-constant-time, and no tool support for checking if
     applications are S-constant-time.
     
     We propose a new information-flow analysis that checks if an x86
     application executes in constant-time, or in
     S-constant-time. Moreover, we prove that constant-time
     (resp. S-constant-time) programs do not leak confidential information
     through the cache to other operating systems executing concurrently on
     virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth
     memory). The soundness proofs are based on new theorems of independent
     interest, including isolation theorems for virtualization platforms
     (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory), and proofs that
     constant-time implementations (resp. S-constant-time implementations)
     are non-interfering with respect to a strict information flow policy
     which disallows that control flow and memory accesses depend on
     secrets.  We formalize our results using the Coq proof
     assistant and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our analyses on
     cryptographic implementations, including PolarSSL AES, DES and RC4,
     SHA256 and Salsa20.}

    This paper presents a formal verification using the Coq proof
    assistant: a formalization of a value analysis (based on abstract
    interpretation), and a soundness proof of the value analysis. The
    formalization relies on generic interfaces. The mechanized proof
    is facilitated by a translation validation of a Bourdoncle
    fixpoint iterator.  
    
    The work has been integrated into the CompCert verified
    C-compiler. Our verified analysis directly operates over an
    intermediate language of the compiler having the same
    expressiveness as C. The automatic extraction of our value
    analysis into OCaml yields a program with competitive results,
    obtained from experiments on a number of benchmarks and
    comparisons with the Frama-C tool.}

  abstract = {  Recent advances in verification have made it possible to envision trusted
  implementations of real-world languages.  Java with its type-safety and
  fully specified semantics would appear to be an ideal candidate; yet, the
  complexity of the translation steps used in production virtual machines
  have made it a challenging target for verifying compiler technology.  One
  of Java's key innovations, its memory model, poses significant obstacles
  to such an endeavor.  The Java Memory Model is an ambitious attempt at
  specifying the behavior of multithreaded programs in a portable, hardware
  agnostic, way.  While experts have an intuitive grasp of the properties
  that the model should enjoy, the specification is complex and not
  well-suited for integration within a verifying compiler infrastructure.
  Moreover, the specification is given in an axiomatic style that is distant
  from the intuitive reordering-based reasonings traditionally used to
  justify or rule out behaviors, and ill suited to the kind of operational
  reasoning one would expect to employ in a compiler.  This paper takes a
  step back, and introduces a Buffered Memory Model (BMM) for
  Java. We choose a pragmatic point in the design space sacrificing
  generality in favor of a model that is fully characterized in terms of the
  reorderings it allows, amenable to formal reasoning, and which can be
  efficiently applied to a specific hardware family, namely x86
  multiprocessors.  Although the BMM restricts the reorderings compilers are
  allowed to perform, it serves as the key enabling device to achieving a
  verification pathway from bytecode to machine instructions.  Despite its
  restrictions, we show that it is backwards compatible with the Java Memory
  Model and that it does not cripple performance on TSO architectures.}

 and existing type systems for low-level languages typically omit objects, 
 exceptions, and method calls. We define an information flow type system for 
 a sequential JVM-like language that includes all these programming features,
 and we prove, in the Coq proof assistant, that it guarantees non-interference.
 An additional benefit of the formalization is that we have extracted from our
 proof a certified lightweight bytecode verifier for information flow. Our work
 provides, to our best knowledge, the first sound and certified information 
 flow type system for such an expressive fragment of the JVM.}

techniques iterate operators on lattices without infinite ascending

in infinite lattices where widening and narrowing are used for
accelerating the convergence. Smart iteration strategies are crucial
when using such accelerating operators because they directly impact
the precision of the analysis diagnostic. In this paper, we show
how we manage to program and prove correct in Coq an abstract
interpreter that uses iteration strategies based on program syntax.
A key component of the formalization is the introduction of an
intermediate semantics based on a generic least-fixpoint operator
on complete lattices and allows us to decompose the soundness proof in an
elegant manner.}
